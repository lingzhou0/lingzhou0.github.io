I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics at the Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/), under the supervision of [Facundo Mémoli](https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1/index.html). I am also an organizer of the weekly meetings of the research group [Network Data Analysis at OSU](https://ndag.github.io/index.html).

My research interests are applied algebraic topology, computational geometry, topological data analysis.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Math and Applied Math at Sichuan University, China. Before coming to OSU in 2017, I earned my Master's degree in Math at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

## Python Projects

- [Steaming-Hot](https://github.com/steaming-hot) - Erdős Institute's Bootcamp May 2021

This is a group project to project to study Steam games and user data, involving classification, prediction and survival analysis. See [video presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pZIWsMBdvSpq5cdf2xH-lJJJgrjKoztv/view).
My contribution includes scrapping monthly time series data over the past 10 years of 10k+ games, exploratory data analysis for 70k+ features of 57k+ games using scatter matrix and histograms, and
a model to find similarity of the trends of different games, to provide advice for game developers.

- [Are you Van Gogh’s](https://github.com/francis2martinez/BootCampProject2020) - Erdős Institute's Bootcamp May 2020

This is a group project to build models for determining whether a painting is in Van Gogh’s style or not. See [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11L6OxCQGkGJyTAa-eNjrDz0ml1L8SGbakbviW9XhUVI/present?slide=id.p). In this project, I applied topological data analysis tool to study the brush strokes of the digitalization of the paintings.
