I am a PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics at the Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/), under the supervision of [Facundo Mémoli](https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1/index.html). 

My research interests are applied algebraic topology, computational geometry, topological data analysis.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Math and Applied Math at Sichuan University, China. Before coming to OSU in 2017, I earned my Master's degree in Math at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
